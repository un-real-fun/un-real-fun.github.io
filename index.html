              <h2>Forest industry is the most iconic example of the economic development in Finland during the 20th Century.</h2>
              <p>
                If you want to select an industry and look at Finland's economic development model in the 20th century, forestry is undoubtedly the representative. In 1920, forest products accounted for 93.7% of Finland's total exports; in 1938, forestry only accounted for more than 80% (Michelsen & Kuisma, 1992). The dominant position of forestry in total export volume was to rise only after the metal industry in the 1960s. It was only broken down by 70%.

  After the war, the forestry led the Finnish economy to recover from the cuts. Despite the limited land area in Finland, the cold climate has caused trees to grow slowly, far behind the tropics, and the human cost is higher than in other countries. Today's Finnish forestry still has a place in the global market, and it is no longer just exporting wood, it is developing high added value. Value of forestry-related products, such as papermaking.

  Paper accounts for two-thirds of Finland's forestry output. Three of the top ten pulp and paper companies in the world are from Finland: Stora Enso, UPM-Kymmene, and Metsä Group. Forestry-related logging and paper-tool machinery industries also saw the presence of Finnish companies.

  Despite the high degree of intensive forestry in Finland, the growth of forest stocks in Finland has been steadily growing since the 1970s under sound legal safeguards and rejuvenation. Now it has returned to the scale of the 19th century (Tables 1 and 2); Nine percent of the country's commercial forests are certified through PEFC or FSC (85%, world average 10%). Today's Finnish forestry, capital and technology intensive, have become a model for sustainable forestry. In the eyes of the people, forestry also enjoys a highly positive image and is considered to be the pillar of the welfare state.

              <p>Finnish and Norwegian scholars <span class="fact" onclick="openNav()">Lehtinen, Donner-Amnell, Bjørnar Sæther et al. (2004)</span> have pointed out that the development of Finnish forestry is in line with the characteristics of Nordic economic development: (i) highly competitive and export-oriented; (ii) based on relatively limited natural resources; (3) Development does not lose control and does not create serious social inequality. This kind of development is hard to see in other regions and is a great achievement.</p>

              <h2>The fomulation of the Nordic model correlated with the democratic governance, dispersed ownership, and active regulation and spport from government.</h2>
              <p>
                Before the eighteenth century, the Swedish system of land was called the solskifte. Most woodlands belong to the King of Sweden or are shared by the villages. The land owned by a village is determined by the sun's range of sunshine between mountains and mountains. It is divided into strips and distributed to households according to whether the land is good or bad, and is converted every year. To some extent, land is held jointly by residents of a locality. In fact, Swedish law was not completely implemented in Finland. Until the middle of the 19th century, the Finnish government began to have specialized forest bureaucracy and manpower management forestry.

                Finnish villages and farms may be separated by tens of kilometers. There are many grey areas between them and there is no clear land holding model. As a result, poor farmers without land slashed their crops, moved around and destroyed forests              </p>

              <h2>Finnish forest industry is export-oriented and highly competitive.</h2>
              <p>In the early 18th century, mercantilism rose in Europe and Sweden, which ruled Finland, carried out the first national cadastral survey in order to increase agricultural productivity and strengthen state management, and allowed the land to be divided and privatized. Such segmentation and privatization, the successive regimes of Russia, as well as the continuation of the independent Republic of Finland, known as the large land reform (The Great Land Reform; Finnish language: Isojako). In just two hundred years, independent farms with woodland grew from 30,000 to over 100,000. Forest land held by individuals and families accounts for more than 60% of the country's forest area (Finnish Forest Association, 2016).

It is worth mentioning that the role played by the war. The civil war after Finland’s independent founding, as well as the international situation of the two world wars, further established a fragmented and decentralized land ownership structure with family ownership as the mainstay.

In 1917, Finland became independent and immediately broke out a civil war. The White Army in the north was supported by Germany and defeated the Red Army government supported by the Soviet Communist Party, consisting mainly of workers and urban residents, and expelled the Red Army leaders eastward. In order to stabilize people's minds and steadily rule, Finland passed a decree in 1922 to further distribute state-owned forest land to workers and tenants.

After 1944, Finland in World War II to continue the war (continuous war) defeat, Moscow signed an agreement with the Soviet Union, Finland and Russia ceded the eastern border areas of Karelian large tracts of land. Finnish nationals in the area can choose to migrate to their home country or remain as Soviet citizens. Most people choose to migrate in order to settle up to 260,000 refugees, the Government of Finland once again distribute a large number of state-owned forest land, the government owned forest land proportion fell from 40% to about 28% (Holopainen, 1968).

        Compared to the companies like Facebook which provide services to users in exchange for their data, the states collect people’s data based on the legality and legitimacy of their own governance. Civil society tends to have a higher standard and more expectation for the transparency and openness on operation of state machine than the counterparts on internal corporate governance. State machine utilises data from their citizens to plan policies and assess the outcome of implementations. Even though governments do not make captical out of data in general, the use of data still underlies and consolidates the political power of states and its centralisation. If citizen's capability of acquiring data from the government is seriously limited and this asymmetry of power deteriorates, they would not be able to understand public affairs in a well-informed manner, and their trust in governments and capabilities of civil participation would be eroded. This is why open data is so important in the age that information is power. It has also become a key indicator of the development of democracy. When people have the right and ability to know, they can have a common cognitive basis for discussing public affairs and thus enjoy better democratic participation qualities.The new nested list provides a comprehensive overview of each teable. Only essential information would be shown at the first glance (e.g. period of data collection and categorical information). Clear, straightforward, so you never mess up.
